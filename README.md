# Warhammer-Adventures-rpg

My first attempts to create something using PyGame. \
The idea is to create something similar to the 'Zelda' game in 2d but in the violent world of Warhammer.\
It is modeled on:\

But as I develop I intend to implement a lot of content.\
\
Until then, I have managed to:\
Day 1 - Create a simple board on which I move the hero.\
Day 2 - Implement simple graphics.\
Day 3 - Implement a simple animation, weapon and magic selection, simple UI. \
Day 4 - Not much, my cat had surgery. He survived. Some new graphics of my making have been implemented.
