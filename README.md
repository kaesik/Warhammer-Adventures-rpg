# Warhammer-Adventures-rpg

My first attempts to create something using PyGame. \
The idea is to create something similar to the 'Zelda' game in 2d but in the violent world of Warhammer.\
It is modeled on:\

But as I develop I intend to implement a lot of content.\
\
Until then, I have managed to:\
Day 1 - Create a simple board on which I move the hero.\
Day 2 - Implement simple graphics.\
Day 3 - Implement a simple animation, weapon and magic selection, simple UI. \
Day 4 - Not much, my cat had surgery. He survived. Some new graphics by my graphic designer have been implemented. \
Day 5 - I added some basic opponents, a typical placeholder. In the future they will be Beastmans or Greenskins. So far I haven't implemented damage, but that will be done tomorrow. \
Day 6 - Today was quite a busy day. I implemented monster damage. I added a magic system, two spells so far. I added particles. I started working on the pause and character development system. \
Day 7 - I added sounds and an attribute upgrade system. The code is getting pretty substantial so I'm starting to enter comments. \
Day 8 - I visit my mother. I haven't done too much, I'm putting some comments in the code.
